Right now your Jukebox can only play one song. Users would like to be able to queue-up songs to be played next so that they can keep listening to your awesome tunes!

## Part 1

1. When the song form is submitted, create a new list item in the "Song Queue" list, containing the song string. ALSO, clear the text field contents.

2. When the "Play" button is clicked:
  - Start playing the top song in the queue.
  - Remove the top song in the queue.
  - When the song is finished playing, repeat with the next top song until there are no songs left to play.

3. When the "Play" button is clicked, slide it up. When the last song is finished playing, slide the "Play" button back down.

## Part 2

1. Add a "Song Name" text field to the page just above the "Enter a song" field.

2. When the "Enqueue Song" button is clicked, add the song's name to the list item you create. Now the queue should include song names AND the song notes themselves.

3. When the Jukebox is playing a song, a message should show on the page saying "Now Playing [Song Name]". When there is no song playing, the message should say "Enter a song to play.".

## Part 3

1. Only show the song's title in the queue. When you move your mouse over a particular song in the queue, however, fade in the song's notes. When your mouse leaves that song, fade the song's notes back out.

2. Start playing songs as above when you press "spacebar". However, make sure you can still enter songs properly in the form (the songs shouldn't start playing if you enter a space while writing the song's notes).
